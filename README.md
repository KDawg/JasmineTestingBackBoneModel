##BackBone Model Unit Testing with Jasmine

Writing reliable JavaScript code at scale is difficult. The language lacks
built-in formal structures that enable reliable engineering practices.
Fortunately establishing convention and selecting mature libraries goes a
long way towards building a trustworthy architecture. Furthermore writing
unit tests gains confidence in our applications.

In this first article in a series on unit testing JavaScript web apps I’ll
show Jasmine for testing an object inheriting from Backbone.Model. In
particular we’ll review simulating service responses and exercising accessor
functions.
